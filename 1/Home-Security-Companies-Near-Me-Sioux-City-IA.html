<p>The downside to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, indicating that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and could even set off false alarms. Incorrect alarms are understood to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the authorities if they happen frequently enough. Another potential downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool should be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is generally balanced out by the reality that there are no installation expenses.</p>
