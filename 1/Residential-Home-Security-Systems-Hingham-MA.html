<p>For these separate systems to converge or to incorporate them together into a single interface, an in-depth understanding of all the needed systems is necessary. If there are no as-built documents supplying performance and configuration info to make this combination work, there are only 2 alternatives. The very first option, which might be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original option provider is not available or unwilling to supply those details) and document the topology and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system.

Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera independently, normally by means of 110VAC power. </p>
