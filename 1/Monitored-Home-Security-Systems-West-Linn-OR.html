<p>The Blink XT2 is small, operates on two AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of free cloud storage, and it captures a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smartphone notifications and live views were painfully sluggish, and the range is bad. Also, if the camera is in the middle of recording, do not expect to get a live peek or make any settings changes-- it can't multitask.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely regular because the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers realize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
