We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare people and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
