<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids speaking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, false alarms are fairly common. If a homeowner forgets their keys and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is triggered by an area feline, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the house owner will be contacted by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it quickly.

Instead, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>

<p>If you do encounter a home intrusion emergency situation, you can set off the 80dB alarm. I am slightly disappointed by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food mill whereas numerous other alarm are as loud as 90dB or even 105dB. Despite that, the alarm needs to suffice to scare away trespassers in most cases. To recover expenses and hold alarm companies accountable for false alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company must be licensed, pay any registration or false alarm fees, and supply physical proof like camera video or a broken window to call for cops action.</p>
