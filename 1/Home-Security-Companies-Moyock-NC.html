<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can identify individuals the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those individuals and will send out smartphone alerts with that details when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify anticipated visitors from random strangers. We likewise discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a wider range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
