<p>Any outdoor camera worth its salt must have the ability to withstand direct exposure to the components and should carry an IP (Ingress Protection) rating IP ratings contain 2 digits that inform you just how well the camera will hold up under many climate condition. The first digit following the IP prefix tells you how resistant the camera is to the ingress of solid things such as wind-blown dust and varies from 0 (no protection) to 6 (total protection versus dust and dirt).

<p>When I ultimately got into the camera controls, I was reasonably satisfied. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a solid night-vision mode, and all the app controls are fairly obvious. You've got two-way audio, you can play tunes simply to let the person being viewed understand they're being viewed, and you can pick to record video clips or images and conserve them to your wise device on an impulse. </p>
