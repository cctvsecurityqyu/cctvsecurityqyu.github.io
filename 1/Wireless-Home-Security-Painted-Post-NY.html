<p>Vivint's monitoring charges remain in line with our other top security companies, which is impressive given the advanced exclusive equipment and services that come with a Vivint home security system.

<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see at night. If recording video in the dark is a concern, make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>It would be easy to roll your eyes at this last point, but it suggests you can ask your home security camera for the weather report - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the unit will respond. It also suggests that if you really saw a burglar riffle through your home, you could quickly record a message to him or her through your smart device, and the Nest would play it aloud. Which, you envision, would be enough to send even the most committed career criminal scampering empty-handed down the roadway. </p>
