<p>When using IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will probably be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large quantity of information required by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and frequently over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, but not suitable with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, removing the requirement for further electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera individually, normally through 110VAC power. </p>
