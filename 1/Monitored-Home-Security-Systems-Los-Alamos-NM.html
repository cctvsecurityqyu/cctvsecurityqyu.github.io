<p>Nothing is more important than protecting what you treasure most ... your family and home. You don't need to buy a multi-million dollar surveillance system to watch on your residential or commercial property and possessions. On the occasion that your alarm system is set off, your home security system sends a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security professionals are waiting to respond by instantaneously getting in touch with you and if need be, the regional medical, fire or cops authorities.</p>
<p>When selecting a home security camera is whether you require an indoor or outdoor  camera, the other major choice. Outdoor cameras will frequently be constructed to be more durable and able to survive rain, frost, or damp.

The technology slowly progressed into the highly advanced yet budget friendly systems available today. The first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to tape-record video and view it later on.
