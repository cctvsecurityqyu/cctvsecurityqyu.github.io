<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, many burglar alarms work the exact same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electric existing. When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the burglar alarm.
