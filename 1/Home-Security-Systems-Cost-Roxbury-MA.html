Abode is one of the best security companies that lets you monitor activity free of charge: All features of their mobile app are available without paid service Very short-term and long-term agreements are offered too.

<p>SimpliSafe equipment covers the basics. But while ADT systems deal with Z-Wave gadgets, SimpliSafe systems don't. This seriously limits your options for syncing a SimpliSafe system with third-party smart home devices like lights, outlets, thermostats, and locks.
