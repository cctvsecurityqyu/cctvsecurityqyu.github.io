<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the same spot and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had set up on the porch by a licensed electrical contractor (who occurs to be my other half). All of the cameras were connected to the exact same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router inside (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to your home was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>We attempted each of the cameras in several places around our house, varying from 6 feet to 30 feet far from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service.
