<p>Outdoor cameras are exposed to the elements, so inspect that the camera you wish to utilize outdoors is certified for that purpose.

Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to irregular and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
