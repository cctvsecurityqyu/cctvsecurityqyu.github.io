<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>

Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for 1 month.
