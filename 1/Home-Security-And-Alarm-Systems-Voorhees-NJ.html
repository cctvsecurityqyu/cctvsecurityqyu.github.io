<p>A tight wire boundary security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to identify any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to neglect things that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
