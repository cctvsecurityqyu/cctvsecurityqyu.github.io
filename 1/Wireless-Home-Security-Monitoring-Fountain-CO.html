The previous, more affordable version of the outdoor Nest webcam is still on sale too if you wish to conserve some cash - it does have actually a cable attached though, rather than working wirelessly, which suggests it's a bit simpler to screw up for possible burglars. Definitely among the very best security cameras in 2020.</p>
