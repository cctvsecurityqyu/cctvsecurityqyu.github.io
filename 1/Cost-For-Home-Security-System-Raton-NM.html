<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we could point them at the same spot and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had actually set up on the patio by a certified electrical expert (who takes place to be my other half).

<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can determine people the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment.

After a while, the camera will discover to recognize those people and will send out smart device informs with that info when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to differentiate anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise found the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a nearby TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a larger series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
