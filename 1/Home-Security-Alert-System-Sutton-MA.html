<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare individuals and general motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
