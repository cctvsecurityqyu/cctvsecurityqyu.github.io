<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally regular since the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody going into the shop.
