It only gets triggered when a human comes in close distance because it utilizes infrared sensing units and mass detection to distinguish between people and other inanimate items or smaller sized living things. You get an alert in your mobile phone app if your motion sensing unit is triggered. There's no latency so you get notified right away so you can take immediate actions such as triggering a loud alarm, calling the authorities, or using the camera's two-way audio system to talk to the potential intruders.</p>
<p>Our alarm systems may be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to recognize an offense. When a zone has actually been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line. As soon as the signal is received, the intruder alarm system will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and shutting off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
