Another potential disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment should be replaced or charged routinely in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is generally offset by the fact that there are no installation expenses.</p>
