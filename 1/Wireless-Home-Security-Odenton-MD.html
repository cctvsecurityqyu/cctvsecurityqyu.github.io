<p>A wired security system was the very first type of security system that was invented for house owners. It must be set up by a professional alarm installation group and, once set up, is tough to move from one location to another. Wired systems are more common for large properties and are typically more pricey than a wireless home security system. They can consist of outdoor cameras and an indoor camera just like the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the group will need to revamp the existing wires in your house. The group will be able to reuse the existing wiring if you have actually already set up a wired system in the past and you are updating to a new system. However, if this is your very first system, the alarm installation procedure can take upwards of 3 hours.</p>
