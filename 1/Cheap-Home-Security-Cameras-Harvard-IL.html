Some systems store recorded video locally on an SD card or a strong state drive, while others offer cloud storage.

The small, black orb of a dome camera provides a much better field of view than its bullet counterpart. It's likewise more subtle, more long lasting types of security cameras on the market.

You've got two-way audio, you can play melodies just to let the person being viewed understand they're being seen, and you can pick to tape video clips or pictures and save them to your smart gadget on an impulse. </p>
