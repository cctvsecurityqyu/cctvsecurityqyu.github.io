<p>Nothing is more crucial than safeguarding what you treasure most ... your household and home. The implicit justification for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the risk of terrorist attacks. But suicide attackers are clearly not discouraged by camera - and might even be brought in to the tv coverage cameras can make sure - and the expenditure of a comprehensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget plan - far surpasses the limited advantages that the system may supply in examining attacks or attempted attacks after the reality (see truth sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>The greatest disadvantage of SmartThings is that there's no camera. As such, if an alarm or sensing unit gets triggered while you're away, you have no visual methods of confirming if something is in fact incorrect and how severe the circumstance is.
