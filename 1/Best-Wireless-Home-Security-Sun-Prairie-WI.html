Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we often discovered action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
