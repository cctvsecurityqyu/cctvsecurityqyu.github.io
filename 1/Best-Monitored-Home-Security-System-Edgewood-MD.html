Both the initial House system and the House Iota are compatible with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, however the Iota is the only design we checked that likewise works with HomeKit. We have actually experienced a couple of technical concerns while long-lasting testing the Home Iota, therefore will continue to check and update appropriately. We no longer recommend it.</p>
<p>Piza and coworkers (2019) carried out a new evaluation of the literature to upgrade a meta-analysis by Welsh and Farrington (2008) that looked at the effects of closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance on criminal activity prevention.
