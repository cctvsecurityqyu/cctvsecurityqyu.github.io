Modern systems now have phenomenal capabilities", though these have developed understandable misgivings about the threat for privacy and possible abuse such abilities produce.

<p>What to consider: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 each month, however you'll pay a little more if you want to include extra features, like a security camera.

<p>The most significant, baddest feature is the Arlo Ultra's 4K video streaming with HDR, which offers you extremely crisp, clear video that lets you zoom in on information like faces and license plates without screwing up your image quality.
