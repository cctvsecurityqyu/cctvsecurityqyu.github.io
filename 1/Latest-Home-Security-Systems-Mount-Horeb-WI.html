Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the price and it does not consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
<p>Thank you men for the aid, what excellent consumer servcie you use. I bought a small (12) camera wireless system for my home and am quite handy to install it myself.

They even called back, the next day to inspect that whatever was still on track.</p>
