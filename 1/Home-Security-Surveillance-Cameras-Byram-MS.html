<p>While every house owner frets about break-ins, suspicion has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces typically resulting in incorrect alarms. Technology combination is one Vivint's strong points. The company's remarkable mobile app has been highly rated by users on both Google Play and the App Shop. It enables customers to check live video feed, trigger and deactivate security systems, and handle their automated home systems including smart locks, the Philips Shade system, and Nest and Component thermostats. Smart systems can connect to Google Home and Amazon Echo, for a smoother automation experience.</p>
