<p>The Frontpoint Security system, in addition to its Interactive plan, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and functions are practically identical to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's strategies are slightly more costly for the very same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation costs are burdensome, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer advise anyway.</p>
