When figuring out how much an alarm system costs customers need to understand that if they include more functions, the price will increase.</p>
<p>Xiaomi's Mi Home Security Camera isn't rather as cheap as our previous pick in this classification-- the $20 Wyze Web Cam V2-- however Xiaomi's Mi Home Security Camera is an even better value at $40.
