<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it offers protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software application to spot it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range.
