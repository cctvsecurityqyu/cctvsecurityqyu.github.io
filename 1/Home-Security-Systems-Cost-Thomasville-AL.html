Flood lights can deter vandals or scare them away, but as a single tool, they are more for your assurance than for home protection.</p>
<p>Night vision: Most burglaries happen after dark, so this feature is nearly as important as motion detection. Technically, the majority of home security cameras support infrared LED lighting, versus real night vision based on image augmentation or thermal vision. Be that as it may, some camera's will change to night vision automatically in low-light conditions, while others allow you to personalize when and how it should be activated.</p>

<p>SimpliSafe drags the competitors on client service front.

<p>What really sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be expensive but is vital. In reality, we do not recommend purchasing this camera at all unless you prepare to include the membership. Without it, you will not get the person-detection feature, adjustable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera found activity.
