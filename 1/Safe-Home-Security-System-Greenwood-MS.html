In your area kept video is a good option for do-it-yourselfers on a budget plan, however you have to take care not to overwrite video you might need later.

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only an incorrect sense of security considering that it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
