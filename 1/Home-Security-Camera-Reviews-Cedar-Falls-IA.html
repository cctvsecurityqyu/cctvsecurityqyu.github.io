<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize individuals the camera is finding utilizing face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name.

We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also supply a broader range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
