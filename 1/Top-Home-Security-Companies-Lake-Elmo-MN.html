<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the big amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and frequently over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trustworthy, but not compatible with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for further electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may require less wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera individually, typically via 110VAC power. </p>
