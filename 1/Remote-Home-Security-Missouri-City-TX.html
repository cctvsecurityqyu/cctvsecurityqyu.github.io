<p>There is a new pattern in surveillance video search innovation that is quickly changing the security industry, and it is called Deep Learning". What is Deep Learning and why is it so crucial?  For beginners, Deep Learning permits somebody to find what they are trying to find without needing to search through hours of worthless video footage.  Envision a webpage that works a lot like a Google search, where you can explain the components you are looking for in the recorded video footage.  For example, if we need to see all video from today that has a police car in it, we just type authorities" into the search window and in seconds every key frame of video with a police car appears.  With deep knowing video search, you now have an effective solution for capturing lawbreakers and collecting proof.</p>
