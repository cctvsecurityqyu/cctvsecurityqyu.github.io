<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally regular since the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once clients realize that the economical customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reputable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for more electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera individually, generally via 110VAC power. </p>
