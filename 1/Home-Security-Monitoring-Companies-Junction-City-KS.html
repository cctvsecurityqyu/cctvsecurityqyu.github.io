Your home burglar alarm, when triggered, will in all likelihood cause a siren or other loud noise to sound, activate outside lights, and use an auto-dialer to notify the local police department directly of a home intruder, or to notify the alarm company's monitoring system who will then contact your local police.">

<p>The Ring Alarm system also has a self-monitoring alternative, something that's unheard of amongst professionally installed systems.
