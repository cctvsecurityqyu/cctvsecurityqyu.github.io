<p>Your CCTV camera might make you feel physically more secure, but after reading this short article, it will sure make you feel practically susceptible. A couple of minutes into the DIY installation, our tester got stuck getting her control board up and online-- it simply wouldn't link.

Definitely not perfect-- however the rep asked forgiveness and delivered her replacement control panel over night.</p>

The system can be established to interact via network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
