<h3>Wireless Home Security Cameras in North Carolina</h3>

<p>Are independently owned, ran surveillance cameras to be dealt with the very same way as public cameras? We also require to draw fine lines about 'Who really is enjoying you'? 'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Big brother? The Corporates? Or harassing neighbour? Who fixes a limit in between public interest and harassment? At the moment, nobody! The camera might legally do what a peeping tom might not do. They could peer within windows with the complete protection of the law on their side. If a person was standing viewing outside a window it might be a criminal activity, yet the exact same person could put a surveillance camera then remotely see a person within the personal privacy of their home. Most significantly, it is not against the penal code.</p>
