<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously outstanding piece of innovation. For starters, it looks stunning: the all-white design and black camera face are seriously spacey (if strangely similar to the AI in 2001: An Area Odyssey). It's far from the horrid metal CCTV box that you may call to mind when you think of a home security camera. The very first wireless function to consider is the security system and its elements, and how they all connect. In the past, every monitoring component was hard-wired back to a panel box.

<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we could point them at the exact same area and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had set up on the porch by a licensed electrical expert (who takes place to be my other half). All of the cameras were linked to the exact same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router indoors (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to your home was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies created their equipment this way to make clients stick with them longer, because changing monitoring companies indicates numerous dollars down the drain and a huge headache for consumers. Alexa assistance is included, as you would get out of an Amazon-owned brand name, and the camera competently manages all the usual functions when it concerns motion detection and two-way audio. Night vision is included too, for when the lights go out. </p>
