<p>Nest Secure provides loads of smart gadgetry-- a lot so that you might get overwhelmed by all of the options. However hey, Nest is owned by Google, so we 'd expect absolutely nothing less! We actually took pleasure in using Nest Secure for home protection and automation, but keep in mind that it can get expensive if you do not currently have a Nest smart home environment set up. If you're going back to square one, we 'd probably advise a company like Vivint, ADT, or Frontpoint.</p>
<p>However monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month fee for a set quantity of time, typically one to 5 years.

Spending for the equipment in advance offers you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service.
