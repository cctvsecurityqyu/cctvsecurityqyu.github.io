<p>After evaluating lots of wired and wireless alternatives, the best home security camera for most people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tapes high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is fully wireless, and can be established both inside your home and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.

<h2>Apartment Building Security Cameras Douglas</h2>
<p>The Residence Smart Security Kit, our previous runner-up, is still a solid option for some people. Residence has upgraded that variation with 4G cellular backup and an onboard Z-Wave 500 Series chip, which offers a better variety for sensing units. Both the original Abode system and the Home Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, however the Iota is the only model we evaluated that likewise deals with HomeKit.

Because this camera has no native geofencing features, you have to manually stop alerts (and recording, given that it does that even when notifications are off). We also experienced above-average connection issues, with two Hive test units detaching 8 times over two months.</p>
