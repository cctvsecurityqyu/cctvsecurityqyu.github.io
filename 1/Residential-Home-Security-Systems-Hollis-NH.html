And the $50-per-month membership cost sounds pricey, but it's not so much when you consider that a live human is viewing a live feed whenever the cameras spot suspicious activity. That person at Deep Sentinel's facility can warn a suspicious individual that they're being observed, and they can call your local cops dispatcher if they refuse to engage or leave in a criminal act.
