<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular considering that the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when customers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
