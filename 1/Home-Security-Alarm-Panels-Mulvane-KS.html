<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as clients understand that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
