<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can identify individuals the camera is identifying utilizing face recognition. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those people and will send mobile phone signals with that info when they show up at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify expected visitors from random strangers.
