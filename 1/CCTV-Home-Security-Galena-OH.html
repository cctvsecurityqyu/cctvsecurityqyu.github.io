<p>You can activate the 80dB alarm if you do encounter a home intrusion emergency situation. I am slightly disappointed by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food mill whereas lots of other alarm are as loud as 90dB or even 105dB. Regardless of that, the alarm must suffice to scare away burglars in many cases. To recoup expenses and hold alarm companies liable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company should be accredited, pay any registration or incorrect alarm charges, and offer physical evidence like camera video or a damaged window to necessitate cops reaction.</p>
