<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally regular because the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers understand that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
