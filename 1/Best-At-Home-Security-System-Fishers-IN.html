<p>The price of admission for the Deep Sentinel Home Security system isn't that steep, even at $499, since it includes three outdoor cameras with two-way audio. And the $50-per-month subscription cost sounds expensive, but it's not so much when you think about that a live person is seeing a live feed whenever the cameras discover suspicious activity.

One benefit of pro setup is getting peace of mind that all access points are guarded. Professional installation can also be especially practical if your home is big, if you get worried by DIY projects, and for numerous other factors.</p>
<p>If I liked the appearance of the Nest, then I love the Hive View's design - definitely the most visually pleasing camera on this list. The good-looking shiny black cube, magnetically attached to a brushed metal stand (mine can be found in a beautiful rose-gold but you can also get it in silver) strikes the best balance in between good-looking and subtle enough to not draw attention to itself.</p>

<p>The Ring Alarm system likewise has a self-monitoring option, something that's unheard of amongst professionally installed systems.
