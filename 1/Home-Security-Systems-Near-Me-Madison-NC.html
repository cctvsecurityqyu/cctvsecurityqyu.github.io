<p>A wired security system was the first type of security system that was developed for property owners. It must be set up by an expert alarm installation team and, when installed, is difficult to move from one location to another. Wired systems are more common for big properties and are often more costly than a wireless home security system. They can consist of outdoor cameras and an indoor camera similar to the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the team will need to revamp the existing wires in your house. The group will be able to recycle the existing electrical wiring if you have actually currently set up a wired system in the past and you are updating to a new system.

<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize people the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those individuals and will send smart device alerts with that info when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise found the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also offer a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
