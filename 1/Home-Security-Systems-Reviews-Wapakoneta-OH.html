In 1997, for instance, a top-ranking cops official in Washington, DC was captured using cops databases to gather info on patrons of a gay club. By looking up the license plate numbers of cars parked at the club and researching the backgrounds of the lorries' owners, he tried to blackmail customers who were married.
