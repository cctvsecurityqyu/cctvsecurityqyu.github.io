<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can determine people the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those people and will send out smart device signals with that information when they appear at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise found the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a broader variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
