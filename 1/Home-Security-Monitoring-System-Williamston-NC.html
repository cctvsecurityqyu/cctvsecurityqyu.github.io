<p>Your CCTV camera may make you feel physically more secure, but after reading this post, it will sure make you feel virtually susceptible. A couple of minutes into the DIY installation, our tester got stuck getting her control panel up and online-- it just wouldn't link. An aid window popped up with a number to call, and a Frontpoint rep helped her troubleshoot the connection. After about 10 minutes, he might tell there was a problem with the circuit board. Definitely not ideal-- however the rep said sorry and delivered her replacement control board overnight.</p>

<p>Xiaomi's Mi Home Security Camera isn't quite as cheap as our previous choice in this classification-- the $20 Wyze Camera V2-- but Xiaomi's Mi Home Security Camera is an even better worth at $40. ADT's credibility and monitoring services stand apart from the remainder of the pack.

<p>Video and image feeds have shown invaluable for surveillance - however there's space for more performance by utilizing audio. People have five senses that collectively allow us to accurately vary our environment.
