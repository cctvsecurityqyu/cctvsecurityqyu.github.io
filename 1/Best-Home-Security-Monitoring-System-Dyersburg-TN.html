<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
