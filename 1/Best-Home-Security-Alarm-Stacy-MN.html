<p>One crucial exception: ADT has a landline monitoring strategy that's $36.99 per month, which could be an inexpensive alternative for customers in backwoods.

If you live someplace without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still better than no security at all.</p>

The noise may frighten off prospective burglars-- if you're fortunate if your system equipment consists of an audible alarm. But the police will not come till you personally call them. </p>
