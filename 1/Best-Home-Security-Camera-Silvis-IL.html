<p>The cover of darkness isn't enough to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does end up being a bit of a problem is between finding and recording movement. It takes a 2nd for the camera to in fact turn on when it detects motion due to the fact that the Pro 2 doesn't do constant video recording.

<p>For these separate systems to assemble or to integrate them together into a single interface, an in-depth knowledge of all the required systems is necessary. If there are no as-built documents providing functionality and setup info to make this integration work, there are only 2 alternatives. The very first choice, which might be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original solution provider is not available or reluctant to supply those details) and record the geography and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system.
