Modern systems now have extraordinary abilities", though these have actually produced reasonable misgivings about the danger for privacy and prospective abuse such capabilities develop.

<p>What to think about: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 per month, but you'll pay a bit more if you want to include additional features, like a security camera. While a normal agreement runs 42 months (one of the longer agreement terms on our list), that requirement is just for users who want to rent their equipment.

<p>What really sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be costly but is important. In truth, we don't advise buying this camera at all unless you plan to add the subscription. Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, adjustable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera detected activity.
