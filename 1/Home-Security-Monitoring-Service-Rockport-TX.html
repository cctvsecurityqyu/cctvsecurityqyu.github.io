Modern systems now have extraordinary abilities", though these have actually produced reasonable misgivings about the danger for privacy and prospective abuse such capabilities develop.

<p>What to think about: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 per month, but you'll pay a bit more if you want to include additional features, like a security camera. While a normal agreement runs 42 months (one of the longer agreement terms on our list), that requirement is just for users who want to rent their equipment.
