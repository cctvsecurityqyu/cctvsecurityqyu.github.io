So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, mobile phone alerts and live views were painfully sluggish, and the variety is poor. Likewise, if the camera is in the middle of recording, do not expect to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal since the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when clients recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
