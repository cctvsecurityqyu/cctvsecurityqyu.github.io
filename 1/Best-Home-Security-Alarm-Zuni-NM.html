Or, if Arlo Pro identifies a sound, you can have your lights set to switch on. Unfortunately, the combination with SmartThings still has bugs and not everything works as it should; nevertheless, the potential is still there.</p>

You can extend the quantity of days you manage buying a subscription, however I don't believe the majority of people will need that alternative.</p>
