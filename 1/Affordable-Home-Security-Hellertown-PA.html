These are the best that do.</p>
<p>The Hive View provides great 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation triggered too easily, even when on the most affordable level of sensitivity setting. Since this camera has no native geofencing features, you need to manually stop alerts (and recording, given that it does that even when notifications are off). We also experienced above-average connection concerns, with two Hive test units disconnecting 8 times over two months.</p>

<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, indicating that storms and strong winds have the power to interrupt the system and might even set off incorrect alarms. Incorrect alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might result in fines from the provider or the cops if they occur frequently enough. Another possible drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool should be changed or charged frequently in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is generally balanced out by the reality that there are no installation costs.</p>
<p>We liked Alder for their quick reaction times and overall flexibility. And controlling our system with their touchscreen panel was quite darn and simple and easy sleek. Otherwise, this company offers a similar feature-set as brands like Frontpoint and Brinks. With the quality of the equipment that is available today, it's safe to say that the wireless systems are just as good, if not better, than the wired systems. Offered all of the other advantages, it's easy to see why so many individuals are selecting this choice. </p>
