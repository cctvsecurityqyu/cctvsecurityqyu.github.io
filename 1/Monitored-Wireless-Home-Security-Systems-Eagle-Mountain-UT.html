So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no idea I remained in, to go out I have to pay $783.  Truly annoying. Once again the sales people, or at least mine, do not discuss the 3 year commitment. I called their customer support group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not have to mention it, it's on you to read the fine print. I'm paying the swelling amount, because obviously they automobile renew you at some time unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a composed not by mail.
