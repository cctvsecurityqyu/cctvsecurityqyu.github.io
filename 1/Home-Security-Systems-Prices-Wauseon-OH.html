<p>When using IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and frequently over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reputable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for more wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera independently, generally by means of 110VAC power. </p>
