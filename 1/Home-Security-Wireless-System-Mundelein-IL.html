<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal because the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once customers recognize that the economical consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
