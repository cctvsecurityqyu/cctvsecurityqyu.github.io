<p>Absolutely nothing is more vital than securing what you treasure most ... your household and home. The implicit reason for the current push to increase video surveillance is the hazard of terrorist attacks. However suicide enemies are clearly not prevented by camera - and might even be drawn in to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expense of a substantial video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up roughly 20 percent of that country's criminal justice spending plan - far surpasses the minimal advantages that the system might offer in examining attacks or attempted attacks after the reality (see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
