<p>Wi-Fi cameras aren't just for recording a thief in the act, however. They're likewise helpful for casual home monitoring.

Most even permit you to communicate with whoever is on-camera as the action is happening, via an embedded microphone and speaker.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
<p>Pan and tilt: If you're seeing animals or older kids remotely from the office or on a beach, you might want to be able to move the camera angle. Arlo Ultra: The Arlo Ultra packs more high-end features into a single camera than we've ever seen before. You'll pay a high price, but you get 4K video resolution, and integrated lights and sirens in return. </p>
