We also like that the Kasa Web cam Outdoor won't spend a lot (it costs $88.16 at the time of writing), and it's incredibly easy to install. Buying multiple Arlo Pro 2's can get pricey. (A four-camera pack expenses $504.72 at the time of writing.) But we can't fault Arlo too much for that-- any premium multi-camera system is going to hit your wallet hard.</p>
