<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it offers protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to discover it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false complacency given that it avoids just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
