<p>This system utilizes an electro-magnetic field disturbance concept based on 2 unshielded (or 'dripping') coax cables buried around 30 cm (1 feet) deep and 1 m (10 feet) apart. 6 The transmitter releases constant Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable television and the energy is received by the other cable television. When the modification in field strength compromises due to the presence of an object and reaches a pre-set lower threshold, an alarm condition is generated. The system is concealed after installation. Care must be required to guarantee the surrounding soil offers good drain in order to prevent nuisance alarms.</p>
