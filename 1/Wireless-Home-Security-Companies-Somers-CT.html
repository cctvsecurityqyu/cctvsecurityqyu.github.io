<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the large quantity of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and frequently over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trusted, but not suitable with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for additional wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera independently, generally via 110VAC power. </p>
