Customers can monitor their homes with the assistance of motion detectors, sensors, and security cameras.

<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it offers protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to detect it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only an incorrect sense of security since it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
