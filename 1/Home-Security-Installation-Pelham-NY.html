For starters, it looks beautiful: the all-white style and black camera face are seriously spacey (if eerily reminiscent of the AI in 2001: An Area Odyssey). It's far from the horrid metal CCTV box that you may recollect when you envision a home security camera.

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false complacency since it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
