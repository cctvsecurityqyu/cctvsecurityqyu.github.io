<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely regular because the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers understand that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
<p>In spite of being a recognized market giant, we were pleasantly amazed by the level of care we received from client service. We were particularly impressed with the customizability choices. Consumers can pick anything from basic monitoring to full-on home security automation, with the right combination of services and gizmos to fit their needs. </p>
