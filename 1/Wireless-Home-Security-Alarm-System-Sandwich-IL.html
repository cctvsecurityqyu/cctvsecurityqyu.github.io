<p>Identity theft (or MAC spoofing) takes place when a hacker has the ability to eavesdrop on network traffic and recognize the MAC address of a computer system with network opportunities Most wireless systems allow some type of MAC filtering to enable only licensed computer systems with particular MAC IDs to gain access and use the network.

<p>Considering that the glass real estate doesn't get in the way, they aren't quite as vandal-proof as dome cameras, however they make up for it in abilities. In addition to being terrific for re-positioning on the fly, they are much better for infrared and low-light because the glass real estate does not restrain the lens. With some, it's hard to tell at a glance where they've been aimed, so they can give a panoptic impression as a deterrent, despite their real field of view.

<p>I discussed that all we would need to do is take advantage of any one of the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also included two-way audio, which camera would end up being the interface into the VMS system. When a patient pushes the emergency button, it sends double informs: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the danger and, if required, might merely push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>
