<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see at night. If recording footage in the dark is a concern, ensure your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
