<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software application to detect it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false sense of security given that it avoids just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
