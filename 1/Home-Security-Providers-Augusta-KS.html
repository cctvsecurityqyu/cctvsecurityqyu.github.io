<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and often over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trustworthy, but not compatible with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for additional circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera separately, generally by means of 110VAC power. </p>
