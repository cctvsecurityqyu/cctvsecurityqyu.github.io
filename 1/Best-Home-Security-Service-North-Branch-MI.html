The deals of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance companies call into question the suitability of the existing trend in U.S. policing of permitting three or four complimentary false alarms per calendar year, because they provide no up-front rewards to encourage owners to prevent incorrect alarms.</p>
