<p>Nevermind how terrific the cameras are. The very first question you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your data to 3rd party companies? I've dumped my Nest Cams since they were bought by Google. Something we all need to consider. Sirens. So your camera has actually detected trespassers or wild animals. Do you want to terrify them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will suffice. Note that these sirens might breach local noise control laws, so check ahead of time before making the purchase.</p>
