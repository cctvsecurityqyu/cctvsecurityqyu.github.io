Bear in mind, most indoor cameras should be plugged into an electrical outlet, which may restrict where the camera sits.

<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month charge for a set amount of time, usually one to five years. No-contract systems, which allow you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than devoting to a long-term arrangement, are becoming more common. These systems sometimes cost more in advance for the hardware than pro systems that offer a discount rate in exchange for that prolonged service arrangement. Paying for the equipment up front provides you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. And you can start and stop the monitoring service as sometimes as you want.</p>
