<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally typical since the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once consumers realize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
