<p>Thermal cameras are the very best alternative for more rugged locations and extreme conditions. These cameras tape the heat patterns of animals and people, hence selecting movement in storms, thick trees or plants, or hazy, smoky, foggy, or dirty conditions. Thermal cameras can be coupled with routine security cameras for optimal security. Motion detection: Assuming you're monitoring your home when it's empty, motion detection is among the most preferable functions in a security camera. Integrated sensors get movement within the camera's field of view and trigger video recording.</p>
