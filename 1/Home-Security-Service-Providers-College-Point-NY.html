<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
