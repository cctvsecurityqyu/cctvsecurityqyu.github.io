<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
