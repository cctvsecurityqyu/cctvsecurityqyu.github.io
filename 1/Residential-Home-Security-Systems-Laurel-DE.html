(A four-camera pack costs $504.72 at the time of writing.) However we can't fault Arlo excessive for that-- any premium multi-camera system is going to hit your wallet hard.</p>

Combining the benefits of a security camera and an intercom gives you a vast array of powerful functions to secure your home or business. The videos your camera records probably will not be saved money on the camera itself.
