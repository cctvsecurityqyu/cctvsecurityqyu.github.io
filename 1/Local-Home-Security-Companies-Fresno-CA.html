<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids talking to someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly typical. If a homeowner forgets their secrets and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is set off by a community cat, it can set off the alarm.

Incorrect alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a property owner won't receive calls from a monitoring company. Rather, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>
