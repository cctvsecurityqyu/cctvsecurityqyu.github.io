<p>Thank you guys for the assistance, what terrific customer servcie you provide. I purchased a small (12) camera wireless system for my home and am pretty handy to install it myself.

<p>While you have to pay for cloud video storage on the Arlo Pro 3, it is among the more inexpensive memberships out there at $2.99 a month. This is a pricey security camera, but we believe it deserves the financial investment.

Lots of websites requiring alarm setups no longer have traditional telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with standard telephone dialer capability do not work reliably over some types of VoIP service.</p>
