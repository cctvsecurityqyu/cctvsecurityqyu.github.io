<p>Piza and colleagues (2019) conducted a new review of the literature to upgrade a meta-analysis by Welsh and Farrington (2008) that took a look at the impacts of closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance on crime prevention.

When a patient presses the emergency situation button, it sends out dual signals: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Furthermore, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the threat and, if needed, could merely push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
