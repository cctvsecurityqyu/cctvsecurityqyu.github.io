<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. In a network injection attack, a hacker can use access points that are exposed to non-filtered network traffic, particularly transmitting network traffic such as Covering Tree" (802.1 D), OSPF, RIP, and HSRP The hacker injects fake networking re-configuration commands that affect routers, switches, and intelligent centers. A whole network can be reduced in this manner and require rebooting and even reprogramming of all intelligent networking gadgets.</p>

Pro-installed systems typically cost more, use equipment comparable to that of Do It Yourself systems, featured long and typically burdensome agreements, and often depend on the exact same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they offer little benefit.
