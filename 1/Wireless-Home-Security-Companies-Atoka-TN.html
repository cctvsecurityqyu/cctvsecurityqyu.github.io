<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
