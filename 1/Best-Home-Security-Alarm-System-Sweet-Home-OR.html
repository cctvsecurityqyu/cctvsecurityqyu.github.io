<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, typically described as shock sensing units, are different because they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Generally, the most extreme frequencies produced are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the kind of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer.
