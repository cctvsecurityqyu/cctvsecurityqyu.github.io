<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, most alarm systems work the exact very same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical present. When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be moved. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which implies when the doors are shut the alarm system will set off.</p>
