<p>Recently, Ring rejected reports that it had suffered a data breach, but we concur with its suggestion that users ought to reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a preventive step. All smart-home devices are susceptible to such incidents.

If you prepare to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video products, we don't think that these concerns alter the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our present recommendation.</p>
