<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video in dark conditions.

This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera independently, typically via 110VAC power. </p>
