<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Available. Requirement elements in the majority of home security packages include a master control panel, the control keypad, sensing unit pads for windows and doors and a motion sensor device. Some systems are linked to an offsite alarm monitoring service, while others have at home alarms. Obviously you can buy more equipment like surveillance cameras, glass break sensing units, CO detectors and smoke detector.</p>
<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, normally referred to as shock sensors, are different because they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Generally, the most intense frequencies generated are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the kind of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional alarm systems, which have a control panel (usually positioned in the entryway hall) that is used to equip and disarm the alarm and alert you if any sensors have been triggered, smart alarms are managed from a smartphone app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you have actually already left home, and informs you if any of the sensing units have actually been activated, rather than getting home to discover your siren has actually been sounding all afternoon (and potentially annoying your neighbours).
