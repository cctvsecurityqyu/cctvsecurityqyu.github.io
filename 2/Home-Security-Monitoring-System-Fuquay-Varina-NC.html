<p>As the name recommends, this alarm is a starter set". So it's pretty much anticipated that it will not have extended customizability or a wide variety of functions. However, I am still disappointed that they have not included at least a basic camera with this set. Cameras are pretty standard for self monitored alarm systems, especially because incorrect alarms is a very real possibility.</p>

<h3>Alarm System With Camera For Home in Fuquay Varina NC</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>

And while this is a quite basic function in indoor cameras, two-way audio is fairly unusual in outdoor security cameras.</p>
<p>There are two primary types of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: internet protocol (IP) cameras and the conventional analog cameras. IP cameras are the more contemporary version of analog cameras, and while the specific cameras tend to be a bit more costly, they provide a number of functions that analog cameras do not.
