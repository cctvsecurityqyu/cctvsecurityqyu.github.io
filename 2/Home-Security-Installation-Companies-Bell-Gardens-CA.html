<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
<p>The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensor to be sensitive, with horrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our system was defective, and so we may review this evaluation.</p>

This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are dependable, but not suitable with IP cameras.
