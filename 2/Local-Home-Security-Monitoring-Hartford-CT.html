<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive plan, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are practically similar to those of the Brinks system.

The group will be able to reuse the existing wiring if you have actually already installed a wired system in the past and you are upgrading to a new system.
