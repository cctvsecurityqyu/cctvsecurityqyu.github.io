<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
