<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large quantity of data required by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and typically over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, however not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for more wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less circuitry in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera independently, generally via 110VAC power. </p>
