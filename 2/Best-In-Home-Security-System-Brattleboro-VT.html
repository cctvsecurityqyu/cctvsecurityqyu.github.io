It records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is totally wireless, and can be set up both inside your home and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have an agreement, and its equipment pricing is super sensible, so it's not an overall splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>
