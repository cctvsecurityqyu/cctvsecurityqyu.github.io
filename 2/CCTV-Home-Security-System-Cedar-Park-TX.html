This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools readily available which can release a dictionary design attack of "perhaps accepted" security keys based on the "model" security key recorded throughout the network recovery.</p>
<p>We're also fans of Vivint's efforts to adjust and improve. Vivint stays up to date with smart home tech.
