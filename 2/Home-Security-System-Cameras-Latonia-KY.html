Monitors can be connected to the DVR for seeing, or the system can be established to interact via network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
<p>A single monitor in the parking garage management office was linked to the output for monitoring cameras.

<p>Our alarm systems may be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to recognize an infraction. As soon as a zone has been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line. Once the signal is received, the intruder alarm will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the alarm system's keypad and shutting off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
