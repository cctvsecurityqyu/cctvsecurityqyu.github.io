<p>Still, if technology has actually made us vulnerable, then it can likewise make us secure. Tech companies have been pressing tough to innovate in the linked home CCTV camera space.

<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were excellent in our screening-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a large, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video.

The one time where lag does become a little bit of a problem is in between detecting and tape-recording motion.
