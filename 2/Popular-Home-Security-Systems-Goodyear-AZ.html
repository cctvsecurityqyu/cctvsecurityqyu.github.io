The deals of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurers cast doubt on the appropriateness of the present trend in U.S. policing of allowing 3 or four free incorrect alarms per fiscal year, since they offer no up-front incentives to encourage owners to prevent false alarms.</p>
