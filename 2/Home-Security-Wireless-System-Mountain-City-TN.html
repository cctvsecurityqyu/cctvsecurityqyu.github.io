<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk to an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimum performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near to the NVR is certainly something to be thought about.

<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video in the dark is a priority.</p>
