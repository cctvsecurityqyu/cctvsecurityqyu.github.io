<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most highly sophisticated outdoor camera we've tested. It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high vibrant variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and people, so it minimizes false alarms, and it can even identify people you have actually labeled (after a knowing duration). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>Our experience with expert installation was blended. Our tester said the professional provided solid customer service: He dropped a couple of unneeded window sensing units from my bill after choosing that the motion detector was sufficient for the entire front half of my home."
