<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most highly sophisticated outdoor camera we've tested. It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high vibrant variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and people, so it minimizes false alarms, and it can even identify people you have actually labeled (after a knowing duration). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>Our experience with expert installation was blended. Our tester said the professional provided solid customer service: He dropped a couple of unneeded window sensing units from my bill after choosing that the motion detector was sufficient for the entire front half of my home." However, there were some issues with connecting the command center to our tester's network. </p>
