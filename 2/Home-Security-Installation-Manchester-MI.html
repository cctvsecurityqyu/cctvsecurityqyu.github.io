<p>When set off, alarm systems most commonly do seven main tasks. The very first task is the alert of a siren, this permits everyone in your neighborhood including the homeowners or company owner to understand that an intruder has been found.

The most typical type of burglar alarms possess a vehicle dialer which notifies cops in the area to dispatch to the business or the home that is being burglarized.

The latter allows you to see exactly when a specific person gets to your home - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time.
