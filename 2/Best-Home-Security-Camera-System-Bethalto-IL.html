We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was likewise plagued with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.

Many sites needing alarm setups no longer have standard telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with conventional telephone dialer capability do not work reliably over some kinds of VoIP service.</p>
