<p>Your CCTV camera may make you feel physically safer, but after reading this post, it will sure make you feel essentially susceptible. A couple of minutes into the Do It Yourself installation, our tester got stuck getting her control board up and online-- it just would not connect. An aid window popped up with a number to call, and a Frontpoint associate helped her troubleshoot the connection. After about 10 minutes, he might inform there was a concern with the circuit board.
