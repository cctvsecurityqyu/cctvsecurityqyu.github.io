We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a wider variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
