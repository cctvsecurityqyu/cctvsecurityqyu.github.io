<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are relied on by more than 60,000 businesses, universities, and federal government facilities, and residential clients. Non-traditional networks such as personal network Bluetooth devices are not safe from hacking and should be considered a security threat. Even barcode readers, handheld PDAs, and wireless printers and photo copiers must be protected. These non-traditional networks can be quickly overlooked by IT personnel who have actually narrowly concentrated on laptop computers and access points.</p>
<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, normally referred to as shock sensors, are different because they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Normally, the most intense frequencies produced are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the type of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
