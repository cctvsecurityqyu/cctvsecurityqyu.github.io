<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to discover it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect complacency given that it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
