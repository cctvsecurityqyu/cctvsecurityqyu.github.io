Nevertheless, smart alarms do require a hub that enables the various components to wirelessly link. But for a lot of clever alarms this hub can be placed anywhere in your home.</p>

<p>Two-way audio: While the idea of a security camera implies eyes-on monitoring, the capability to likewise hear what's going on provides you a more total image of what's taking place on the home front when you're away.

<p>According to IndustryARC insights, the night vision devices market has been proliferating in the last couple of years - driven by increased public need and surveillance activities. Night vision is an important feature of video surveillance, especially for outdoor security. It allows professionals to determine and deter criminal offense during the night when your business is most vulnerable to break-ins, robberies, and vandalism - making it a financial investment that should not be ignored.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize people the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those people and will send smart device alerts with that info when they appear at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
