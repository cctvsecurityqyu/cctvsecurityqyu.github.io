<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare individuals and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
