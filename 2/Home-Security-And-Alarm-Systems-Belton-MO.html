<p>You can use a wireless connection to run your SimpliSafe system, but it does not support Z-Wave, Zigbee, or IFTTT, implying you will not be able to connect it straight to other third-party devices like smart locks or automate certain actions in the home.

When a patient pushes the emergency situation button, it sends out double informs: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Furthermore, if the central patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the danger and, if required, could merely push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
