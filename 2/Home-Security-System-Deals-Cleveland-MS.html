<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal given that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers understand that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
