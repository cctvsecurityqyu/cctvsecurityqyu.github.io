<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can determine people the camera is finding using face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those individuals and will send smart device signals with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to differentiate predicted visitors from random strangers. We likewise discovered the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
