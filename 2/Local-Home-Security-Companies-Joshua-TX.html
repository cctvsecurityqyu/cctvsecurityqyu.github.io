<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare people and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>

<p>IP security cameras catch analog images and transform them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing capabilities like compression and motion detection.
