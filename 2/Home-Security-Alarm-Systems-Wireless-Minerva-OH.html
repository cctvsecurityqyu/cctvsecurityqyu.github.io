<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it offers protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false complacency considering that it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
