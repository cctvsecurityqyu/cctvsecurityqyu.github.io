<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, usually referred to as shock sensing units, are various because they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Usually, the most extreme frequencies generated are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the type of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer.

<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk with an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimum efficiency. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near the NVR is absolutely something to be thought about. For instance if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of an issue but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on 2nd story wall, this would cause a disruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is an excellent option for long range circumstances where poles and trees are not present.</p>

<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to sign in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We first saw Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it quickly ended up being a staff (and friends and family) favorite. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send notifies, you can't control it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
