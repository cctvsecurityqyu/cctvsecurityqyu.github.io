It works with Amazon Alexa, and it offers its own wise door lock, however you can't go setting up numerous third-party devices with your SimpliSafe system. It doesn't deal with Z-Wave or IFTTT, and we don't anticipate it to include extra functionality anytime quickly.</p>
<p>No matter the resolution, try to select a camera with a reasonably wide field of view (viewing angle) and make certain it can capture clear night vision video. A lot of cameras utilize IR (infrared) LEDs to deliver black-and-white night video, however there are a few out there that use white light to deliver full-color night video. Search for a camera with a night vision range of a minimum of 30 feet.</p>

Without it, you will not get the person-detection feature, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera detected activity.
