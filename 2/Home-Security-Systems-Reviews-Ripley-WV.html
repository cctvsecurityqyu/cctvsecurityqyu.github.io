<p>Some security cameras enable you to set up custom-made activity zones, indicating that you choose the areas that are most considerable for recording movement.

If your alarm is activated, designated authorities will be dispatched to your home or business' location.

Wireless security systems are more integratable and agile, however low signal strength and bad connectivity are still common complaints. Hardwired systems need minimal maintenance, and except a general power outage, are more difficult to disrupt. Regardless of a general enhancement in wireless technology, there seem fewer methods for hardwired systems to be interfered with and incapacitated. </p>
