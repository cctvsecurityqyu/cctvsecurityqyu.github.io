<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>
