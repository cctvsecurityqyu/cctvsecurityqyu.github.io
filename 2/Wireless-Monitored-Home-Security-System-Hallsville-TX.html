<h3>Wireless Home Security in Texas</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don.

<p>Nest's stylish video doorbell is a wise, smooth pick that aced our tests. Features like person detection and geofencing are practical and user friendly, and you can also upgrade to the Nest Aware cloud membership service to allow facial recognition and access to saved recordings. What's cool about this camera is is the PIR motion detection and numerous user function. More people can see previous recordings at the exact same time. The main account can access the web cam and share videos with others through encrypted transmission technology.</p>
