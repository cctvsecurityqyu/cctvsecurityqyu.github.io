<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between people and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>

So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no concept I remained in, to go out I need to pay $783.  Truly frustrating. Once again the sales people, or at least mine, do not discuss the 3 year commitment. I called their customer service group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not have to discuss it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the lump sum, because apparently they vehicle renew you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a written not by mail.  ADT is a problem, way too expensive, and not great.</p>
<p>There are 2 outdoor security camera styles - dome or bullet-shaped.
