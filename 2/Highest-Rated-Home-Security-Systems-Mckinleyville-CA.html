<p>Nevermind how terrific the cameras are. The very first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your information to 3rd party companies? I've dumped my Nest Cams given that they were purchased by Google. Something we all need to think of. Sirens. So your camera has found burglars or wild animals. Do you want to terrify them off?

Cameras that are not monitored by the main station can not be accessed our operators for any reason, even if asked for by the consumer. </p>
