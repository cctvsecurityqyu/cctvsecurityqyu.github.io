<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a malicious assailant, considering that the disturbance of the network avoids the circulation of data and in fact indirectly secures information by preventing it from being transferred.

This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools offered which can launch a dictionary style attack of "possibly accepted" security secrets based upon the "design" security key captured during the network healing.</p>
