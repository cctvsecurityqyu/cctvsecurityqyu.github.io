<h3>Home Security System Review in New Jersey</h3>
<p>Remember that Nest cameras aren't expertly monitored-- that part's on you. (The rest of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) However since the majority of retail theft wouldn't trip an alarm anyhow (a staff member slipping some additional money while offering a consumer modification, for instance), we think it's more crucial to have premium images so you have the proof you require. And that's what Nest offers you.</p>
<p>No matter the resolution, attempt to pick a camera with a reasonably large field of vision (seeing angle) and make sure it can record clear night vision video.

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
