<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive plan, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016.

However, Frontpoint's plans are a little more expensive for the same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation charges are difficult, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyway.</p>
