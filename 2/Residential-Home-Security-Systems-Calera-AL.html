<p>The cover of darkness isn't enough to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does end up being a little an issue is in between detecting and tape-recording movement.

<p>The Blink XT2 is small, operates on two AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of complimentary cloud storage, and it records a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, mobile phone notifications and live views were painfully sluggish, and the range is bad. Also, if the camera is in the middle of recording, don't expect to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>
<p>In addition to the system itself, security alarms are typically paired with a monitoring service. In case of an alarm, the properties manage unit contacts a central monitoring station. Operators at the station see the signal and take suitable action, such as getting in touch with property owners, notifying cops, or dispatching personal security forces. Such signals might be sent via dedicated alarm circuits, telephone lines, or the internet.</p>
