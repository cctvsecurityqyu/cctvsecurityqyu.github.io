<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can identify individuals the camera is finding utilizing face acknowledgment. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name.

We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to differentiate predicted visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TELEVISION).
