<p>A tight wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to identify any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to neglect items that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires.
