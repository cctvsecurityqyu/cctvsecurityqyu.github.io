<h2>Home Monitoring & Automation University Place</h2>
<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really idea of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, spanning several decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly evolved into the extremely advanced yet inexpensive systems offered today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to tape-record video and view it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to improve the outcome of security systems.</p>
<p>IP security cameras catch analog images and transform them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection. The captured digital video stream is then relayed over a local area network (LAN) using Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable television to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which catches each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and review. The system can be set up to communicate through network or mobile app for seeing.</p>

With GO2 as your video surveillance camera installer, your business is supplied important insights into your operations that would otherwise be unattainable.</p>
<h3>Security Alarm System in University Place WA</h3>

Some systems can be set up to allow deactivation of specific sensors or groups.  High-end systems allow several access codes, and might even permit them to be used only once, or on particular days, or only in combination with other users' codes (i.e., accompanied). In any case, a remote monitoring center need to set up an oral code to be offered by a licensed person in case of false alarms, so the monitoring center can be guaranteed that a further alarm action is unneeded. Just like gain access to codes, there can also be a hierarchy of oral codes, say, for furnace repairperson to go into the kitchen area and basement sensing unit areas but not the silver vault in the kitchen. There are likewise systems that allow a duress code to be entered and silence the local alarm, but still activate the remote alarm to summon the cops to a robbery.</p>

When the modification in field strength weakens due to the existence of an object and reaches a pre-set lower threshold, an alarm condition is generated. The system is hidden after installation.
