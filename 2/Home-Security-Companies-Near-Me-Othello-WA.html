Once any alarm incorporated into the PCU was activated, the closest camera to that place would be displayed on that specific monitor. The chance that the fixed camera would be pointed in the instructions of the event depends upon the initial requirements for location of coverage. If there are 3 choose fire escape, panic alarms, or door sensors, a single set camera can only view one. This creates a one in 3 chance of capturing a specific occurrence on video (either live or recorded).
