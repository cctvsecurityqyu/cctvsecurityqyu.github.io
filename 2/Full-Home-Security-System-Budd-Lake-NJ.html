<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed appearances and face recognition software application. The latter allows you to see exactly when a particular person gets to your home - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time. However Netatmo has expanded its security variety with a brilliant outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a three pack of weatherproof doors and window sensors referred to as Tags (₤ 89.99).
