<h3>Security Camera Installation in Santa Barbara CA</h3>
<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously excellent piece of innovation. For starters, it looks beautiful: the all-white style and black camera face are seriously spacey (if strangely similar to the AI in 2001: A Space Odyssey). When you envision a home security camera, it's far from the ghastly metal CCTV box that you may call to mind. The very first wireless function to consider is the security system and its parts, and how they all connect. In the past, every monitoring element was hard-wired back to a panel box. This indicated every door and window needed its own wire and course of holes through your house.</p>
<p>Identity theft (or MAC spoofing) takes place when a hacker is able to eavesdrop on network traffic and determine the MAC address of a computer system with network advantages Most wireless systems enable some sort of MAC filtering to enable only licensed computer systems with specific MAC IDs to gain access and utilize the network.

<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it provides protection only when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect sense of security considering that it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
