<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize individuals the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name.

We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
