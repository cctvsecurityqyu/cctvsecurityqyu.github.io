<p>Think about it in this manner, if a good still-camera costs a minimum of two hundred and fifty dollars (US $), how can a more advanced video camera be cost the low cost of forty dollars? It just does not build up. To provide such low prices, makers need to cut corners, and the end result is compromised performance.
