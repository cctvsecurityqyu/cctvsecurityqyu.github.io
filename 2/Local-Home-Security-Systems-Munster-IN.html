The previous, more affordable variation of the outdoor Nest cam is still on sale too if you wish to save some cash - it does have actually a cable connected though, instead of working wirelessly, which implies it's a bit simpler to sabotage for possible trespassers. Certainly among the best security cameras in 2020.</p>
