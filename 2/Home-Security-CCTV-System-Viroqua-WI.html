<p>Surveillance systems present police "bad apples" with an appealing chance for criminal misuse. In 1997, for example, a top-level cops official in Washington, DC was captured using police databases to collect info on customers of a gay club. By searching for the license plate numbers of cars parked at the club and investigating the backgrounds of the vehicles' owners, he attempted to blackmail clients who were married. Imagine what someone like that could do with a citywide spy-camera system.</p>

<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were impressive in our screening-- throughout the day and during the night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the image quality based on available bandwidth, which could fluctuate throughout the day. Nest includes the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that may defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
