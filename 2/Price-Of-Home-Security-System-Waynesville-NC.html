<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big quantity of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and typically over fars away.

Wireless security cameras might need less circuitry in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera separately, normally through 110VAC power. </p>
