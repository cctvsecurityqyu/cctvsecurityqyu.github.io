For beginners, Deep Learning allows somebody to discover what they are looking for without needing to search through hours of ineffective video footage.  Think of a website that works a lot like a Google search, where you can describe the elements you are searching for in the tape-recorded video footage.  For instance, if we need to see all video from today that has a police car in it, we just type cops" into the search window and in seconds every key frame of video with a patrol car appears.  With deep learning video search, you now have a powerful service for catching lawbreakers and collecting proof.</p>

The systems with video storage usually consist of either a local storage or cloud storage alternative. A local storage option conserves a pre-determined number of video clips on the device itself.

However, this is typically a paid service and the variety of hours it will store will depend on how much cloud storage you want to pay for.</p>
