<h2>The Benefits Of Monitoring Niles</h2>
<p>Analog security cameras transmit lower resolution video over coax cable and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can deal with such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom.

To recoup costs and hold alarm companies liable for false alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company must be licensed, pay any registration or incorrect alarm fees, and offer physical evidence like camera video footage or a damaged window to call for cops action.</p>
