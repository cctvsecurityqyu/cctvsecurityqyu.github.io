<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular given that the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
