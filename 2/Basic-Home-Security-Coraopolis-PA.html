It records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is totally wireless, and can be set up both inside your home and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have an agreement, and its equipment rates is very sensible, so it's not an overall splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>

<p>Fleenor utilizes wireless monitoring for their alarm systems. Monitoring agreements are available at 36 months. Many of the significant home security systems now offer video doorbells of their own, and some deal compatibility with standalone video doorbells and keypads like these, too.

<p>If I liked the look of the Nest, then I like the Hive View's style - definitely the most aesthetically pleasing camera on this list. The good-looking glossy black cube, magnetically attached to a brushed metal stand (mine can be found in a charming rose-gold however you can also get it in silver) strikes the perfect balance in between subtle and attractive enough to not draw attention to itself.</p>
