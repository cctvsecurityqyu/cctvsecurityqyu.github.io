<p>ADT authorized provider SafeStreets charges a $99 (or more) installation cost, however the brand doesn't otherwise charge up front for a system it states deserves $1,300. The equipment's all offered by 3rd parties, so what you receive might be from a different producer than the equipment your next-door neighbor got. Why's that?

<p>The Frontpoint Security system, in addition to its Interactive plan, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and features are almost similar to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's plans are slightly more costly for the very same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation costs are difficult, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer advise anyhow.</p>
<p>It's not just about security from theft, either. Adam Kostecki, the senior assistant vice president of digital solutions and innovation at Amica, recommends sensors that focus on things you wouldn't otherwise observe, like leak sensors or freeze sensing units.
