It works either connected to power or with its built-in battery-- and it's the only Canary camera that you can utilize inside and outdoors.</p>

It can compare basic motion and individuals, so it reduces false alarms, and it can even recognize individuals you've identified (after a learning duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
