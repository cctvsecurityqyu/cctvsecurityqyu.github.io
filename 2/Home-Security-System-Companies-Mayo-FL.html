The same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about four times as much image information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also made in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.

<p>Keep in mind that Nest cameras aren't expertly monitored-- that part's on you. (The rest of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) However since most retail theft wouldn't journey an alarm anyway (a staff member slipping some extra money while giving a client change, for instance), we think it's more important to have premium images so you have the proof you require. And that's what Nest provides you.</p>
<p>The Maximus Smart Security Light gives you a classy method to put a security camera on your home. Because both included options to add professional monitoring, we recommend the Iota. We prefer home security that includes video surveillance, and the Abode Iota makes it inexpensive and simple. For all its versatility, we want the Circle 2 featured a local storage choice. As it is, you'll have to register for a cloud plan to get more than 24 hours of video history.</p>

When possible, we checked each camera using an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) along with an Android mobile phone (using a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint offers a wide array of equipment and home automation items at an affordable cost, the one area where the company especially stands out is in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
