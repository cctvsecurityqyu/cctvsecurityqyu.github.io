This Canary Flex is a home security camera that packs a big punch in a little bundle.

<p>We tried each of the cameras in multiple locations around our house, varying from 6 feet to 30 feet far from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we checked each camera using an iOS gadget (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) along with an Android mobile phone (using a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint offers a wide range of equipment and home automation items at a sensible cost, the one area where the company especially excels remains in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
