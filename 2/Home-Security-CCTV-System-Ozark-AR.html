When possible, we checked each camera using an iOS gadget (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) along with an Android mobile phone (using a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint offers a wide range of equipment and home automation items at a sensible cost, the one area where the company especially excels remains in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
