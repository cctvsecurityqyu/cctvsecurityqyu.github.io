Placed on tables, racks, and counter tops, they allow you to watch on what your family pets are doing, understand when the kids get home from school, or discover who's been hitting the alcohol cabinet. Many even enable you to interact with whoever is on-camera as the action is taking place, by means of an ingrained microphone and speaker.</p>
<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing video footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
