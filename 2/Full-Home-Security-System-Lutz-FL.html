But neither can record continuously, and they both need the Ring Secure plan to catch recordings.

We advise the 8-piece security package as the best method to take full advantage of Ring's budget friendly home security options because we understand all the ins and outs of Ring Alarm. Unless you only have one door and one window, you'll need more than the lone contact sensing unit that is available in Ring's five-piece kit.</p>
