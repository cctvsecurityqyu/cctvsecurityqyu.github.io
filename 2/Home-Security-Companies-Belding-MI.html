Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing, thanks to irregular and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
