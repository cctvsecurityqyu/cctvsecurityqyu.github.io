<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
