<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between people and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
