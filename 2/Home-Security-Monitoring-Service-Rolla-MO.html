<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear video in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
