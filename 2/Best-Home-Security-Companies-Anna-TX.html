<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal since the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.

Although FrontPoint provides a wide array of equipment and home automation items at a reasonable rate, the one area where the company especially stands out remains in DIY installation. </p>
