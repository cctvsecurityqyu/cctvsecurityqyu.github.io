On the easier side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of smart home equipment for versatility and low prices. SimpliSafe does have a video doorbell with two-way audio, however you can't include a ton of other wise home tech to the system. It won't work with loads of smart home equipment from other companies. The app is extremely impressive, and while the level of control does not match SmartThings, producing 'Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or turning up the heat when you journey the motion sensor in the morning - are refreshingly simple.</p>
<p>Secure America's Do-It-Yourself security package uses a setup process that is easy and user-friendly. All of the equipment is pre-programmed prior to shipping, so clients require only to install sensing units in their entranceways and windows.

<p>The San Diego Police Department intended to access to footage from private and public cameras in real time as part of the Operation Secure San Diego" surveillance program Since 2014, the program was riddled with software compatibility issues, and officers had difficulty viewing video in genuine time due to the fact that the department's police car did not have a 4G connection.
