<p>Seattle's primary intent with this law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies more liable for incorrect alarms, and minimize the number of unnecessary cops and fire actions. Alarm monitoring companies are the experts and should be teaching their clients how to correctly set and care for their alarm systems. National and local data have actually proven that raising fines paid directly by businesses and property owners have had no substantial influence on minimizing the number of false alarms. Alarm-monitoring companies have enjoyed the advantage of police response to their consumers' alarms with no accountability for the accuracy or dependability of those alarms.</p>
