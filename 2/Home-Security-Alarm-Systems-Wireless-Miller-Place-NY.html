Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only an incorrect complacency considering that it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
