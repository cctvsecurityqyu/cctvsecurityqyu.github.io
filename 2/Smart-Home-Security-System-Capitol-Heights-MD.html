<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software application to find it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false complacency given that it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>

<p>During the spring and summer months, home security or alarm companies work with taking a trip sales representatives to go door-to-door, making unsolicited "cold calls" on house owners.

<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can identify individuals the camera is identifying utilizing face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name.

Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
