<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. If recording video footage in the dark is a concern, make certain your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
