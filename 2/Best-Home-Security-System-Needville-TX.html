I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker.

<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and typically over long distances.
