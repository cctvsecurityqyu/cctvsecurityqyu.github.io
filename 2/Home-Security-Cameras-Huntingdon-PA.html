<p>Are independently owned, ran surveillance cameras to be treated the very same way as public cameras? We also require to draw great lines about 'Who really is viewing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Huge brother? The Corporates? Or bothering neighbour? Who draws the line in between public interest and harassment? At the moment, nobody! The camera could legally do what a peeping tom might not do. They might peer inside of windows with the full protection of the law on their side. If an individual was standing viewing outside a window it could be a criminal offense, yet the exact same individual might position a surveillance camera then remotely see a person within the personal privacy of their home. Most importantly, it is not versus the penal code.</p>
