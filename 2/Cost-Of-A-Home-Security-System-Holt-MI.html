<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize people the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those individuals and will send smartphone informs with that info when they appear at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a broader range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
