Outdoor cameras will typically be constructed to be more resilient and able to endure rain, frost, or damp.

Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan option. Sure, you get a lower cost if you go with a three-year agreement, however considering that Nest requires you to pay 100% of your remaining contract if you cancel, it's a big commitment.
