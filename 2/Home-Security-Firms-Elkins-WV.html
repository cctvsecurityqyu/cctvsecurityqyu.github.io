We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare people and general motion.
