With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be contacted by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it rapidly. Incorrect alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a property owner will not receive calls from a monitoring company. Rather, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>
