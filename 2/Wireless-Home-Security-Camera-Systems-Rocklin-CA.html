<p>Unlike standard alarm systems, which have a control board (typically located in the entryway hall) that is used to deactivate the alarm and arm and alert you if any sensors have been triggered, clever alarms are managed from a mobile phone app. The app lets you arm and disarm the alarm, even if you've currently left home, and alerts you if any of the sensors have been set off, instead of getting home to find your siren has actually been sounding all afternoon (and possibly irritating your neighbours). Nevertheless, wise alarms do need a center that allows the various components to wirelessly link. But for a lot of smart alarms this hub can be put anywhere in your home.</p>
<p>Having animals indicates you will need to consider their size, motions, and any other factors that might cause problems. For example, if you have family pets that are over 30 pounds, you will need a security system whose motion sensors can be adjusted or a system that can be installed in such a way that your big pets will not trigger false alarms to be sent out each time your pet relocations. If you have big family pets, you might wish to consider skipping the motion sensing units and rely more on the doors and window sensors which aren't activated by movement but are triggered when a window or door is opened.</p>
<p>Even though 1080p is typically the basic resolution for cameras we've evaluated, there are advantages to designs with higher-resolution sensing units. Few home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, but practically all have digital zoom, which crop and enlarge whatever the camera is recording. The more megapixels a camera sensor has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still be able to see things plainly.</p>
<p>As you simply learned, there are two broad classifications of security cameras. What you normally find at shops are consumer-grade cameras, which usually come 8 or 16 cameras bundled with a video recorder and sell for less than a thousand dollars (US $) for the set.

The video recorder must be purchased individually, and commercial grade recorders begin at about $500 (United States $) and can vary up to $5000 depending upon the amount of storage, camera connectivity, and image processing features.</p>
