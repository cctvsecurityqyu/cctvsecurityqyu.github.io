Expert installation with professional monitoring: Brands like Vivint and ADT expertly install and monitor your system-- you don't have to lift a finger or babysit alerts. Over my 25 plus year career in the security market, I have investigated, offered, set up, and since we have our own central station at American Alarm Systems, viewed alarm signals for more hours than I wish to admit.</p>
<p>After checking dozens of wired and wireless alternatives, the best home security camera for many people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tapes high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is fully wireless, and can be established both indoors and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint doesn't have a contract, and its equipment prices is super reasonable, so it's not an overall splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>

All these considerations will impact what system you eventually select. For instance, if you need to capture high-definition surveillance video over extended periods, bandwidth is a consideration.</p>
