<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal since the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
