<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, a lot of burglar alarms work the exact very same way. They use open and closed circuits to move an electric current. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If someone were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical existing to stream throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will trigger.</p>
