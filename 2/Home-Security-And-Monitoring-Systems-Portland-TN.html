<p>What really sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be pricey but is vital. In reality, we don't suggest purchasing this camera at all unless you plan to include the subscription.

Having the ability to distinguish between an automobile and an individual, for instance, allows you to minimize unnecessary signals. And Activity Zones are a great perk, specifically if you're wanting to monitor a specific corner of the yard, a doorway, or perhaps trash bin. </p>
