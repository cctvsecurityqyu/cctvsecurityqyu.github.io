<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when customers understand that the economical customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
<p>It would be easy to roll your eyes at this last point, but it suggests you can ask your home security camera for the weather report - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the unit will reply. It also implies that if you actually saw a burglar riffle through your home, you might rapidly tape a message to him or her through your smartphone, and the Nest would play it aloud. Which, you imagine, would be enough to send even the most dedicated career criminal scuttling empty-handed down the road. </p>
