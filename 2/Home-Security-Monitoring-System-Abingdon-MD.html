<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it provides protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to detect it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only an incorrect complacency considering that it avoids just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
