<p>During the spring and summertime, home security or alarm companies employ taking a trip sales representatives to go door-to-door, making unsolicited "cold calls" on property owners.

<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can determine people the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send out smart device alerts with that details when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also provide a broader series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
