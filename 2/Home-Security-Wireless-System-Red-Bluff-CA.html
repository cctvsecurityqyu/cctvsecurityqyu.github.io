In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls need to be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs confirmation from a private guard. Several cities likewise require a license to even own and operate a home security system. Rules such as these are designed to restrict the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on false alarms. Numerous towns will fine you for a lot of incorrect alarms.</p>

The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be accomplished with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a greater compression ratio than 5:1, with a somewhat lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be used up versus the quality of image needed or preferred). The highest photo quality of DVD is just slightly lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>

<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the very same spot and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather condition.
