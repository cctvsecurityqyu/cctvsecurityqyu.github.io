Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are practically identical to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's strategies are slightly more expensive for the very same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation charges are difficult, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer suggest anyhow.</p>
