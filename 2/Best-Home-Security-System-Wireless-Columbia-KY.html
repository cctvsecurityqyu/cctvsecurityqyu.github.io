<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range".

As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody going into the shop.
