We initially observed Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it rapidly ended up being a personnel (and family and friends) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send out alerts, you can't control it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technically advanced outdoor camera we've tested. It has a close-up tracking function, which instantly zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of view.

It can compare general motion and individuals, so it cuts down on incorrect alarms, and it can even identify individuals you've labeled (after a knowing duration). However like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
