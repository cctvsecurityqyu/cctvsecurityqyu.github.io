The instructions are incredibly extensive and the 200m variety of the alarm system implies it can be used to safeguard garages and sheds as well as your home.

<p>When the alarm is tripped, an on-site ringer will typically trigger a bell or siren attached to the building. Similarly, when an automated dialer alarm is tripped, a telephone call is automatically placed to the cops or fire departments, and a pre-recorded statement is played when that call is addressed. Automatic dialer alarms are not allowed to call 9-1-1.</p>
<p>Are you in a home with a pre-wired security system? If so, having a hardwired security system set up may be an easier and more inexpensive choice.

While wireless home security systems are popular and understood for a much easier, more streamlined installation, hardwired systems are more trusted since they aren't based on disturbance.</p>
