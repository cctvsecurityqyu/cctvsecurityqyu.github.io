<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
