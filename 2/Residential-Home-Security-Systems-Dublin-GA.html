<p>When selecting a home security camera is whether you require an outdoor or indoor camera, the other major choice. Outdoor cameras will often be built to be more able and resilient to make it through rain, frost, or damp.

Luckily, I've tested out dozens of cameras and condensed everything I have actually found out into the list below.
