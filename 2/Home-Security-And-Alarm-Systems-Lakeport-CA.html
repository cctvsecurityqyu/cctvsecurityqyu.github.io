<p>Seattle's main intent with this law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies more responsible for incorrect alarms, and lower the number of unneeded police and fire reactions. Alarm monitoring companies are the specialists and should be teaching their clients how to appropriately care and set for their alarm.
