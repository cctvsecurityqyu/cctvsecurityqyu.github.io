We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between people and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
