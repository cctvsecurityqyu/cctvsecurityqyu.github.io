<p>The Ring Alarm system also has a self-monitoring option, something that's unheard of among expertly set up systems. That implies even if you do not pay the month-to-month fee, the system will still notify you through your smart device if it identifies a threat, but you are responsible for contacting emergency situation services such as the authorities or fire department-- so your phone needs to stay on and you need to be ready to field signals, even at 2:00 a.m. It's good that the system has a monitoring choice, though, in case you don't constantly desire that duty, such as when you're on vacation.</p>
