No-contract systems, which allow you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis instead of committing to a long-lasting plan, are becoming more typical. These systems sometimes cost more in advance for the hardware than professional systems that use a discount rate in exchange for that prolonged service arrangement.
