Strategies consisted of searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV assessment research study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV evaluations, and contacting leading researchers to inquire about forthcoming assessments. Both released and unpublished reports were consisted of in the search, which was not limited to the English language and was global in scope.</p>
