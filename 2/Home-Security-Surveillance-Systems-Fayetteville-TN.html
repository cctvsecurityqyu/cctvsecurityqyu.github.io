<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were excellent in our screening-- throughout the day and at night-- with a large, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We should note that the camera would occasionally downgrade the photo quality based on readily available bandwidth, which might fluctuate throughout the day.
