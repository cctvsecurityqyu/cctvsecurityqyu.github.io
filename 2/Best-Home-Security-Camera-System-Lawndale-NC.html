<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids talking to somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively common.

With a professionally monitored system, the house owner will be called by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it quickly. Incorrect alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a house owner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Rather, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the essential action.</p>

The previous, more affordable variation of the outdoor Nest camera is still on sale too if you want to save some cash - it does have a cable television connected though, instead of working wirelessly, which means it's a bit easier to mess up for potential intruders.

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
