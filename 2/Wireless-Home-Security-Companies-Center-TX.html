<p>A system that needs an agreement may be a smart choice for those who are cash-strapped or do not wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Due to the fact that contract-based security systems typically do not included upfront charges. Rather, the costs are expanded over the length of the agreement. We've seen 1-year, all the method as much as 5-year agreements!

The system can be set up to interact by means of network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
