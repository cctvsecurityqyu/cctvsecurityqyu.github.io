<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it relies on a wireless signal, suggesting that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and could even trigger false alarms.

Another possible downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool need to be replaced or charged routinely in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is normally offset by the reality that there are no installation expenses.</p>
