Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just a false complacency since it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
