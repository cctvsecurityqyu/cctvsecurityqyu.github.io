<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has clearly tried to offer it an appealing edge, and we need to give credit to its ability to reveal what's going on from approximately 4 cameras at a time. It can be slow and uncomfortable to use on occasion - with the process of connecting to the camera for a live view rather languid at times.

Definitely among the very best security cameras in 2020.</p>
