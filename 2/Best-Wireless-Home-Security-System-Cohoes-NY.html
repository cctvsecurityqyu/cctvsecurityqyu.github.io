<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Property protection gadgets are developed to secure specific, tangible possessions, such as precious jewelry, paintings, money boxes, and household heirlooms. These devices can be equipped with anti-tampering technology to avoid being deactivated. The sensor will trigger an alarm if the product to which the gadget has been attached is moved or interrupted.</p>
<p>Doorbell Camera - Vivint's doorbell camera with night vision lets you see who's at your door anytime. It's triggered by motion and sends out informs to your smart phone as required. For example, A visitor approached your door" will be sent out with video. Video is taped with a 180-degree lens, and a sound system lets you talk with visitors. In The Sims, a burglar alarm will cover a whole space when put indoors. It will cover a 5-tile radius if put on an outside wall.</p>
